A dirt jump simulator for mtb, dj, and bmx.
This simulator is step far beyond the old and somewhat popular (now defunct) non graphed jump calculator at https://trailism.com/jump-design/ .
The goal is to help diggers dig, shape, pack, and ride more safely, lowering (not eliminating) serious injuries on jumps.
I took inspiration from skijump.info, and others trying to incorporate Equivalent Fall Heights. This is an open source Humanist venture.
More features to come I hope.
